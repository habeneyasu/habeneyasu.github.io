            <div class="project-challenge-solution">
              <p class="project-description"><strong>Challenge:</strong> Adey Innovations faced increasing fraud losses across e-commerce and banking platforms, with existing rule-based systems generating too many false positives (blocking legitimate transactions) while missing sophisticated fraud patterns. The system needed to detect fraud in real-time (<100ms) with high accuracy, provide explainable decisions for regulatory compliance, and reduce false positives to maintain customer trust.</p>
              <p class="project-description"><strong>Solution:</strong> Architected and deployed an end-to-end fraud detection system unifying e-commerce and banking transaction data. Built a Stacking Ensemble (XGBoost + LightGBM) achieving 95%+ recall while reducing false positives by 40%. Integrated SHAP explainability for transparent decision-making, handled extreme class imbalance (<1% fraud) using SMOTE, and deployed containerized FastAPI microservice with sub-100ms latency. Established full MLOps pipeline with MLflow, Docker, and GitHub Actions CI/CD.</p>
              <p class="project-description"><strong>Impact:</strong> Achieved 95%+ fraud detection recall, protecting millions in transaction value while reducing false positives by 40% to maintain customer trust. Reduced alert investigation time by 25% through SHAP-driven insights, enabling fraud ops team to focus on high-priority cases. Sub-100ms latency enables real-time transaction approval without customer friction, while complete audit trail ensures regulatory compliance.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
              <strong>Key Technical Implementation:</strong> Cleaned and merged the Fraud_Data.csv and creditcard.csv datasets. For e-commerce data, performed geolocation integration by mapping IP addresses to countries and engineered critical time-based features like time_since_signup and transaction velocity. Addressed the critical imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) on the training set and employed Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure reliable performance estimation, prioritizing Precision-Recall AUC and F1-Score as primary metrics over accuracy. Built and compared multiple models, selecting a Stacking Ensemble of XGBoost and LightGBM as the champion model after rigorous hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search. Integrated SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to demystify the model's "black-box" nature, generating summary plots for global feature importance and force plots for individual predictions. Containerized the inference service with Docker, managed the complete model lifecycle (experiment tracking, versioning, staging) with MLflow, and established an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for testing and deployment.
